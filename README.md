# ðŸ“± CryptoTracker

## Overview
This practice project allows users to track real-time cryptocurrency data fetched from an external API and to manage a simulated investment portfolio. The primary focus of this project is implementing a clean, scalable architecture and mastering the asynchronous data flow, data persistence, and multi-threading essential for production applications.

> ðŸ’¡ **Built to showcase:** Combine, Networking, CoreData, Observation (migrated from ObservableObject), Multi-threading, MVVM.

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |

| Architecture | MVVM |
| Tools | Xcode, GitHub, GitFork |

## Features

1. View a list of crypto data from API.
2. View details of the coins including a chart for coin price.
3. Search coins.
4. Add own coins for portfolio.

## Lessons Learned

* **Reactive Programming, Asynchronous Programming, Networking:** Implemented data fetching from API, decoding of downloaded JSON data, and processing data (e.g. filtering for search) using Combine.
* **Data Persistence:** Use of CoreData to persist API and user data and FileManager to persist images.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Applied MVVM and service layers to handle data, resulting in ViewModels that may easily be testable and Views that remain simple and focused on UI logic.
* **Custom UI Development:** Developed custom SwiftUI views (e.g. custom tab bar, reusable card components).
* **Performance Optimization:** Use of LazyHStack, LazyGrid, and a custom NavigationLink for lazy loading.
