# CryptoApp â‚¿

A cryptocurrency market data and portfolio manager app. Built with Swift and SwiftUI. It uses MVVM Architecture, Combine, CoreData, and benefits from multi-threading, publishers/subscribers, and data persistence. This project reflects my learning progress and experimentation in iOS Development.
